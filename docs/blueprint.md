## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light teal (#A7DBD8) for a calming, trustworthy feel, suitable for healthcare applications.
- Background color: Very light grayish-teal (#F0F8F7). This is subtly related to the primary hue but desaturated, allowing other elements to stand out.
- Accent color: Soft peach (#FFB38A) to highlight important interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that is suitable for both headlines and body text and provide readability.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for navigation and common actions (e.g., a paw print for patient records, a stethoscope for examinations).
- Use a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy to make the forms easy to navigate and fill out.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., form submission, data saving).
